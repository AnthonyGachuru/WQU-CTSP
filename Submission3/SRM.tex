In this paper we discuss short rate models with a focus on two factor Hull-White model.  In the first section we discuss models for short rate, in the second section we describe the two factor Hull-White model in mathematical terms, in the third section we compare this model to Ho-Lee Model, Vasicek Model, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model, Single factor Hull-White model,  in the fourth section we present a derivative product payoff using the two factor Hull-White model. and we conclude by discussing the purpose of this paper.

\section{Introduction
}
There are several frameworks to model interest rates, for this paper we will focus on models for short rate.  These models are useful for the valuation of options for which we need an estimate of how much interest rates can change in future.  The short rate $r_t$ is considered to be continually compounded interest rate, where one can borrow or lend money at an infinitesimally short period of time $t$. \\

Short rate models are rooted in the Vasicek model \cite{BN1} which is considered endogenous with time homogeneous parameters (constant over time).  The models extending on the work of Vasicek model have time dependent parameters such as the Hull-White model \cite{HW1}. \\

Short rate models are divided in two categories.  The first one is equilibrium models, Vasicek model and Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (CIR) model are examples of equilibrium short rate models.  The second one is the arbitrage free models, the Ho-Lee model and the Hull-White model are example of arbitrage free models.  We discuss all these models in Section 3. \\ 

The short rate models are either single factor or multi factor, for this paper we will only focus on One-factor short rate models and a two factor short rate model \cite{BA1}.  One factor  models involve a single stochastic factor which is the short rate to determine the future movements of all interest rates.  \\

TODO: Write intro of a two factor model.

\section{Comparison with Single Factor Short Rate Models
}

\subsection{Comparison with Vasicek model
}
The Vasicek Model \cite{Vas1} model is one of the earliest stochastic models of the term structure of interest rate.\\

The Vasicek model describes short interest rates as follows,
 \[
dr_t = \alpha(\beta - r_t) dt + \sigma dW_t
\]
Where,\\
$\alpha =$ Speed of mean reversion $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1 $ \\
$\beta =$ Mean reversion level  \\
$r_t$ = Short rate  \\
$\sigma$ = Short rate volatility \\
$W_t$ = Brownian motion process  \\

The model exhibits mean reversion, over time interest rate converge to the mean reversion level $\beta$ at the speed of $\alpha$.  In comparison to the two factor Hull-White model it exhibits several short comings such as there is no term structure volatility, there is only one factor which assumes short rates correlated, it is an endogenous model containing time homogeneous parameters which do not vary over time.


\subsection{Comparison with Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model
}

The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model was developed in 1985 \cite{CIR1} by J. C. Cox, J. E. Ingersoll and S. A. Ross.  This model is considered an improvement to the Vasicek model and the square root element does not allow for negative rates.\\

The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model describes short interest rates as follows,
 \[
dr_t = \alpha(\beta - r_t) dt + \sigma \sqrt{r_t} dW_t
\]
Where,\\
$\alpha =$ Speed of mean reversion $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1 $ \\
$\beta =$ Mean reversion level  \\
$r_t$ = Short rate  \\
$\sigma$ = Short rate volatility \\
$W_t$ = Brownian motion process  \\

The model exhibits mean reversion, over time interest rate converge to the mean reversion level $\beta$ at the speed of $\alpha$.  In comparison to the two factor Hull-White model it exhibits several short comings such as there is no term structure volatility, there is only one factor which assumes short rates correlated, it is an endogenous model containing time homogeneous parameters which do not vary over time.

\subsection{Comparison with Ho-Lee model
}
Ho-Lee model developed in 1986 \cite{HoLee1} by Thomas SY Ho and Sang-Bin Lee, it is a single factor short rate model used in pricing of interest rate derivatives.  It was the first model arbitrage free computational lattices for evolution of short interest rates.  Ho-Lee assumed interest rates have a normal distribution.

The Ho-Lee  model describes short interest rates as follows,
 \[
dr_t = \theta_t dt + \sigma  dW_t
\]
Where,\\
$\theta_t =$ Drift  \\
$\sigma$ = Short rate volatility \\
$W_t$ = Brownian motion process  \\

This model permits both the drift to be function of time and it produces an instantaneous short interest rate that has a normal distribution it exhibits no mean reversion.  In comparison to the two factor Hull-White model it exhibits several short comings such as there is no term structure volatility, there is only one factor which assumes short rates correlated.

\subsection{Comparison with Hull-White model
}
Hull-White model developed in 1990 \cite{HW1} by John C. Hull and Alan D. White, it is a single factor short rate model used in pricing of interest rate derivatives.  It is also known as the Extended Vasicek Model.\\

The Hull-White model in essence is the same as the Vasicek model with time dependent parameters and describes short interest rates as follows,
 \[
dr_t = (\theta_t - \alpha_t r_t) dt + \sigma_t  dW_t
\]
Where,\\
$\theta_t =$ Drift  \\
$\alpha_t =$ Time dependent Speed of mean reversion $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1 $ \\
$\sigma_t$ = Time dependent Short rate volatility \\
$W_t$ = Brownian motion process  \\

The Hull-White model also assumes that short rates have a normal distribution it exhibits mean reversion.  In comparison to the two factor Hull-White model it exhibits several short comings such as there is no term structure volatility, there is only one factor which assumes short rates correlated.
