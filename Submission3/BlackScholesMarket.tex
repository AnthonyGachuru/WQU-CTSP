\begin{abstract}
In this paper we discuss the interest rate models with a focus on two factor Hull-White model.  In the first section we discuss models for short rate, in the second section we describe the two factor Hull-White model in mathematical terms, in the third section we compare this model to Ho-Lee Model, Vasicek Model, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model, Single factor Hull-White model,  in the fourth section we present a derivative product payoff using the two factor Hull-White model. and we conclude by discussing the purpose of this paper.

\section{Introduction
}
There are several frameworks to model interest rates, for this paper we will focus on models for short rate.  These models are useful for the valuation of options for which we need an estimate of how much interest rates can change in future.  The short rate $r_t$ is considered to be continually compounded interest rate, where one can borrow or lend money at an infinitesimally short period of time $t$. \\

Short rate models are rooted in the Vasicek model \cite{BN1} which is considered endogenous with time homogeneous parameters (constant over time).  The models extending on the work of Vasicek model have time dependent parameters such as the Hull-White model \cite{HW1}. \\

Short rate models are divided in two categories.  The first one is equilibrium models, Vasicek model and Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (CIR) model are examples of equilibrium short rate models.  The second one is the arbitrage free models, the Ho-Lee model and the Hull-White model are example of arbitrage free models.  We discuss all these models in Section 3.

}


\section{Comparison with Single Factor Short Rate Models
}

\subsection{Comparison with Vasicek model
}
The Vasicek Model \cite{Vas1} model is one of the earliest stochastic models of the term structure of interest rate.

\subsection{Comparison with Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model
}

\subsection{Comparison with Ho-Lee model
}
Ho-Lee model developed in 1986 \cite{HoLee1} by Thomas SY Ho and Sang-Bin Lee, it is a single factor short rate model used in pricing of interest rate derivatives.
