\begin{abstract}
In this paper we discuss the interest rate models with a focus on two factor Hull-White model.  In the first section , in the second section we describe the two factor Hull-White model in mathematical terms, in the third section we compare this model to Ho-Lee Model, Vasicek Model, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model, Single factor Hull-White model,  in the fourth section we present a derivative product payoff using the two factor Hull-White model. and we conclude by discussing the purpose of this paper.

\subsection{Comparison with Ho-Lee model
}
Ho–Lee model developed in 1986 \cite{HoLee1} by Thomas SY Ho and Sang-Bin Lee, it is a single factor short rate model used in pricing of interest rate derivatives.
