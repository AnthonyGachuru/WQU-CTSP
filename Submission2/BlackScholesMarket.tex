\section{Introduction
}

Black-Scholes model is a commonly used option pricing model. This model was discovered by the economists Black and Scholes \cite{BS1} in 1973.  The modelling assumptions for this paper are as follows.  The market consists of two assets, the first one is risky asset which is the stock $S$ and the second one is riskless asset the bank account $B$. \\

The riskless asset denoted by $B$ and is modelled by a differential equation 

\[
dB_t=r B_t dt
\]

The risk-free interest rate $r$ is constant.\\

The risky asset denoted by $S$ and is modelled by the following SDE
\[
dS_t= S_t(\mu dt + \sigma dW_t) 
\]

If we apply It\={o}'s lemma, we get.

\[
S_t= S_0 e^{(\mu- \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t  + \sigma W_t} 
\]

\[
B_t= B_0  e^{rt}
\]

Therefore, $S_t$ is a geometric Brownian motion with drift $(\mu- \frac{\sigma^2}{2})$ and volatility $\sigma$.  Additional assumptions include costless trading, constant divided on the risky asset and restrictions on the riskless asset. \\



\section{Lookback options 
}
\subsection{Nature of Lookback options
}

Lookback options are financial derivatives whose payoff depends on the maximum or the minimum price of the underlying assets during a certain period of the life of the option contract. Different schemes of choosing the strike price give different types of lookback options. In this section, we discuss four most common types of lookback options, namely fixed strike call/put options and floating strike call/put options.

For fixed strike options, the strike price is determined at purchase. The payoff for call option is the difference between the maximum asset price during the option life and the predetermined strike price, written in full:
\[
H=max(M_{T_0}^T - K, 0)
\]
where $K$ is the predetermined strike price and $M_{T_0}^T=\max_{T_0 \leq t \leq T}(S_t)$ is the maximum price of the underlying asset during the lookback period. Similarly the payoff of fixed strike put option is written as:
\[
H=max(K - m_{T_0}^T, 0)
\]
with $m_{T_0}^T=\min_{T_0 \leq t \leq T}(S_t)$ being the minimum price of the underlying asset during its lookback period.

For the floating stike counterparts, the strike price is determined automatically at maturity such that it is beneficial for the holder. The payoff for call option is the difference between the asset price at maturity and the minimum asset price during its lookback period. Payoff function for call and put function is given respectively:
\[
H=max(S_T - m_{T_0}^T, 0)
\]

\[
H=max(M_{T_0}^T - S_T, 0)
\]

Given the payoff functions as above, in 2.3 we are going to solve their PDE to derive the price for each of these options in the same manner as pricing Vanilla European options with Black-Scholes PDE.
But first, let us look at some examples of lookback options in real life.
\subsection{Examples of Lookback options
}

In reality, lookback options, as well as other exotic options, are commonly not traded publicly on exchanges but over-the-counter (OTC).
Suppose we bought 2 lookback call options, one with fixed strike \$100 and one with floating strike
on an underlying stock when it was also trading at \$100 with 1 year maturity.
During that one year, the price of the stock goes up to \$150 at ceiling, hits bottom at \$80, and goes back to \$100 at maturity.
When we exercise the contract, for the fixed strike option we gain a profit of \$150 - \$100 = \$50,
since the payoff depends on the most favorable price of the underlying stock.
For floating strike option, since the lowest price of the stock is \$80 and current price of the stock is \$100,
the profit is \$100 - \$80 - \$20.
Lookback options are said to have anti-regret properties, in ways that investors do not have to regret
selling too early or holding on too long to be suddenly swept by a correction. \\

Let's take another example. Consider two same options, with the underlying stock still having \$150 at high
and \$80 at low, but now the stock price at maturity is \$130. The profit for fixed strike option remains the
same in this case at \$50, but the floating strike option makes profit of \$130 - \$80 = \$50. \\

In the third scenario, consider the stock price closes off at its bottom \$80. That sets the strike price at \$80 too,
and yields zero profit for the floating strike option. The profit for fixed strike option does not depend on
the stock price at maturity in case it is still higher than its lowest point during the lookback period.
\subsection{Analytical solution for Lookback options
}
\subsubsection{Fixed strike lookback call option
}
Let $\widetilde{W}$ be a $\mathbb{P}^{\star}$-Brownian motion. As we know, the asset price $S_t$ follows the dynamics:
\[
dS_t=S_t(rdt + \sigma d \widetilde{W_t})
\]
which yields
\[
S_t=S_0 e^{(r - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t + \sigma \widetilde{W_t}}
\]
Now we calculate the price of the fixed strike call option that we define above at time of purchase $T_0=0$
\begin{align*}
\pi(H) 	&= \mathbb{E^{\star}}[e^{-rT} max(M_{T_0}^T - K, 0)] \\
			&= e^{-rT} \mathbb{E^{\star}}[max(M_{0}^T - K, 0)] \\
			&= e^{-rT} \int_{0}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}^{\star}[M_{0}^T - K \geq x]dx \\
			&= e^{-rT} \int_{0}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}^{\star}[M_{0}^T \geq x+K]dx \\
			&= e^{-rT} \int_{0}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}^{\star}[ln \frac{M_{0}^T}{S_0} \geq ln \frac{x+K}{S_0}]dx \\
			&= e^{-rT} \int_{K}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}^{\star}[ln \frac{M_{0}^T}{S_0} \geq ln \frac{z}{S_0}]dz &(\text{change of variable } z=x+K) \\
			&= e^{-rT} \int_{K}^{\infty} ( 1 - \mathbb{P}^{\star}[ln \frac{M_{0}^T}{S_0} \leq ln \frac{z}{S_0}])dz &(1)
\end{align*}
Now we define a stochastic variable $Y_T= ln \frac{M_{0}^{T}}{S_0}$. By \cite{Peter1},
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}^{\star}[Y_T \leq y]= \Phi \left(\frac{y-(r-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} \right) - e^{\frac{2r}{\sigma^2} - 1} \Phi \left(\frac{-y-(r-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} \right)
&, y \geq 0
\end{align*}
Let $y=ln\frac{z}{S_0}$, from (1) we have
\begin{align*}
\pi(H) 	&= e^{-rT} \int_{ln\frac{K}{S_0}}^{\infty} S_0e^y( 1 - \mathbb{P}^{\star}[Y_T \leq y])dy \\
			&= e^{-rT}S_0 \int_{ln\frac{K}{S_0}}^{\infty} e^y \left( 1 -  
			\Phi \left(\frac{y-(r-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} \right) + e^{\frac{2r}{\sigma^2} - 1} \Phi \left(\frac{-y-(r-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} \right)
			\right) dy \\
			&= e^{-rT}S_0 \int_{ln\frac{K}{S_0}}^{\infty} e^y \left( 
			e^{\frac{2r}{\sigma^2} - 1} \Phi \left(\frac{-y-(r-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} \right)
			+ \Phi \left(\frac{(r-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T - y}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} \right)
			\right) dy \\
			&= S_0 \Phi(d) - e^{-rT}K \Phi(d - \sigma \sqrt{T} ) \\
			&\hspace{1cm} + e^{-rT}\frac{\sigma^2}{2r}S_0 \left[
			e^{rT}\Phi(d) - \left(\frac{S_0}{K}\right)^{\frac{-2r}{\sigma^2}} \Phi\left(d- \frac{2r}{\sigma}\sqrt{T}\right)
			\right]
\end{align*}
where $d = \frac{ln\frac{S_0}{K} + (r+\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}$

\subsubsection{Fixed strike lookback put option
}
The fixed strike lookback put option can be priced in similar way.
\begin{align*}
\pi(H) 	&= \mathbb{E^{\star}}[e^{-rT} max(K - m_{0}^T, 0)] \\
			&= e^{-rT} \mathbb{E^{\star}}[max(K - m_{0}^T, 0)] \\
			&= e^{-rT} \int_{0}^{K} \mathbb{P}^{\star}[max(K - m_{0}^T, 0) \geq x]dx  &(0 \leq max(K - m_{t}^{T}, 0) \leq K)\\
			&= e^{-rT} \int_{0}^{K} \mathbb{P}^{\star}[m_{0}^T \leq K-x]dx \\
			&= e^{-rT} \int_{0}^{K} \mathbb{P}^{\star}[ln \frac{m_{0}^T}{S_0} \leq ln \frac{K-x}{S_0}]dx \\
			&= -e^{-rT} \int_{0}^{K} \mathbb{P}^{\star}[ln \frac{m_{0}^T}{S_0} \leq ln \frac{z}{S_0}]dz &(\text{change of variable } z=K-x) \\
			&= -e^{-rT} \int_{0}^{ln\frac{K}{S_0}} S_0e^{y} \mathbb{P}^{\star}[y_T \leq y]dy &(2)
\end{align*}

Again, we define the stochastic variable $y_T= ln \frac{m_{0}^{T}}{S_0}$. By \cite{Peter1},
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}^{\star}[y_T \geq y]= \Phi \left(\frac{-y+(r-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} \right) - e^{\frac{2r}{\sigma^2} - 1} \Phi \left(\frac{y+(r-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} \right)
&, y \leq 0
\end{align*}
Let $y=ln\frac{z}{S_0}$, from (2) we have
\begin{align*}
\pi(H) 	&= e^{-rT} \int_{0}^{ln\frac{K}{S_0}} S_0e^y( 1 - \mathbb{P}^{\star}[y_T \geq y])dy \\
			&= e^{-rT}S_0 \int_{0}^{ln\frac{K}{S_0}}  e^y \left( 1 -  
			\Phi \left(\frac{-y+(r-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} \right) + e^{\frac{2r}{\sigma^2} - 1} \Phi \left(\frac{y+(r-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} \right)
			\right) dy \\
			&= e^{-rT}S_0 \int_{0}^{ln\frac{K}{S_0}} e^y \left( 
			\Phi \left(\frac{y-(r-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} \right) + e^{\frac{2r}{\sigma^2} - 1} \Phi \left(\frac{y+(r-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} \right)
			\right) dy \\
			&= -S_0 \Phi(-d) + e^{-rT}K \Phi(-d + \sigma \sqrt{T} ) \\
			&\hspace{1cm} + e^{-rT}\frac{\sigma^2}{2r}S_0 \left[
			\left(\frac{S_0}{K}\right)^{\frac{-2r}{\sigma^2}} \Phi\left(-d+ \frac{2r}{\sigma}\sqrt{T} \right) - e^{rT}\Phi(-d)
			\right]
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Floating strike lookback call option
}
In the last two sections, we have already done all the heavy lifting of deriving the price equations for fixed strike lookback options.
In the next two sections, we will show that the price of floating strike lookback options can be easily deduced from their fixed counterparts.

Consider first a floating strike call option's price $\pi(H) = \mathbb{E^{\star}}[e^{-rT} max(S_T - m_{0}^T, 0)]$.
It is obvious to see that $S_T \geq m_{T_0}^T$, always, by definition. Hence we can rewrite
\begin{align*}
\pi(H) 	&= \mathbb{E^{\star}}[e^{-rT} (S_T - m_{0}^T)] \\
		&= e^{-rT} \mathbb{E^{\star}}[S_T - m_{0}^T] \\
		&= e^{-rT} \mathbb{E^{\star}}[(S_T - S_0) + max(S_{0} - m_{0}^T, 0)] \\
		&= e^{-rT} \mathbb{E^{\star}}[S_T - S_0] + e^{-rT} \mathbb{E^{\star}}[max(S_{0} - m_{0}^T, 0)] \\
\end{align*}
Now we can see that the second addend is exactly the price of a lookback put option at fixed strike $S_0$.
Substitute the formular in 2.2.2, we have
\begin{align*}
\pi(H)	&= S_0 \Phi(d_0) - e^{-rT}S_0 \Phi(d_0 - \sigma \sqrt{T} ) \\
		&\hspace{1cm} + e^{-rT}\frac{\sigma^2}{2r}S_0 \left[
			\Phi\left(-d_0+ \frac{2r}{\sigma}\sqrt{T} \right) - e^{rT}\Phi(-d_0)
		\right]
\end{align*}
where $d_0 = d|_{K = S_0} = \frac{(r+\frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}} = (\frac{r}{\sigma} + \frac{\sigma}{2})\sqrt{T}$
\subsubsection{Floating strike lookback put option
}
Using the same logic to relate the price of a floating strike lookback put option to the price of a fixed strike lookback call option.
We have
\begin{align*}
\pi(H) 	&= -S_0 \Phi(-d_0) + e^{-rT}S_0 \Phi(-d_0 + \sigma \sqrt{T} ) \\
		&\hspace{1cm} + e^{-rT}\frac{\sigma^2}{2r}S_0 \left[
			e^{rT}\Phi(d_0) - \Phi\left(d_0 - \frac{2r}{\sigma}\sqrt{T} \right)
		\right]
\end{align*}
\section{Barrier options
}


\[
dX_t=\sigma(X_t)dW_t + \mu(X_t) dt
\]


\section{Compound options
}
A compound option is a standard option for which the underlying asset is another standard option. Geske \cite{Geske1} suggests this option can be generalized to value many corporate liabilities.  Since the overlying and underlying are both options there are two strike prices and two exercise dates. 

\subsection{Examples of Lookback options
}

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we went through derivations of pricing formulas for Lookback Options, Barrier Options and Compound Options using Black Scholes model.  We also presented brief examples of real world use cases of each of the options discussed.  The purpose of this paper was to discuss the set of tools to value exotic options.
